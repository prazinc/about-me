# about-me
My name is Robin Brooks
Pastor, Mother, Entrepreneur.  I have over 20 years IT experience and recently left my position to pursue a personal project.  I recently had a program created and launched it as a side hustle and the program brought in so much profit that it allowed me to become debt free and leave my full time job.
I am in the Bootcamp so that i can learn how to code and create other programs and apps.

Hobbies:
singing, teaching, and developing innovative programs to automate and simplify processes.
